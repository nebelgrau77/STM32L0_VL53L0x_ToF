# Time of Flight sensor

Testing STM VL53L0X time-of-flight sensor with  Rust on STM32L031 (Nucleo32 L031K6 board) 
At the moment it's just reading the distance in single mode, and printing out to serial.

TO DO:
* print the distance to an OLED display
* use a timer to trigger measurements
* react to the distance, e.g. turn the LED on/off
